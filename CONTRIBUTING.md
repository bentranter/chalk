# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! This project follows the proposed [Go Code of Conduct](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/13073-code-of-conduct.md)

Since this is a small repo, I don't think there's much sense in enforcing strict conventions. If you add something, just try to write a test for it.
